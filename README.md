WGU Computer Science Projects Overview

This repository contains my completed WGU Bachelor of Science in Computer Science projects, covering real-world skills across software engineering, backend development, Java frameworks, data structures, optimization, and machine learning.
Each project was built from scratch, following industry-level requirements such as REST API design, Spring Boot architecture, multithreading in Java, Docker containerization, machine-learning pipelines, and algorithmic problem solving.

C867 — Scripting & Programming Applications (C++)

A console-based student roster management system written in C++.
You built:

Full class architecture (Roster, Student subclasses, etc.)

Parsing CSV input into objects

Validation (emails, age ranges)

Dynamic arrays and memory management

Search and CRUD operations

Skills: C++, OOP, classes/constructors, arrays, parsing, debugging.

D287 — Java Frameworks (Spring) – “Furniture Depot”

A Spring Boot web app managing a furniture inventory system.
You built:

RESTful endpoints for creating, updating, deleting items

MySQL/SQLite data persistence with JPA & Hibernate

Service and repository layers

MVC project structure

Unit tests for core services

Skills: Java, Spring Boot, JPA, REST APIs, MVC, SQL, dependency injection.

D288 — Back-End Programming – “Travel Agency API”

A backend service implementing a real-world travel booking workflow.
You built:

Multi-endpoint REST API (flights, customers, reservations)

JSON request/response handling

Error handling and validation layers

Database CRUD operations

Postman API testing

Skills: REST API design, Java, Spring Boot, data models, HTTP methods, testing.

D387 — Advanced Java – “Landon Hotel” Project

An advanced multithreaded and Dockerized Java system for hotel translation and operations.
You built:

File I/O processing for large datasets

Packaged the entire application into a Docker container

Logging, exception handling, and configuration management

Skills: Java concurrency, multithreading, Docker, I/O streaming, performance tuning.

D682 — AI Optimization for Computer Scientists – “Urban Air Quality”

A machine-learning optimization project analyzing environmental data.
You built:

Feature engineering for air-quality datasets

Multiple ML optimization algorithms

Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation

Data cleaning pipelines

Visualizations of predictions and accuracy

Skills: Python, scikit-learn, optimization, regression/classification, EDA, metrics.

D683 — Advanced AI & ML – “Customer Churn Prediction”

A full ML lifecycle project using the Kaggle churn dataset.
You built:

Full preprocessing pipeline (encoding, scaling, handling imbalance)

Model comparison across multiple algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

Evaluation using ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, F1

Final production-ready model selection with justification

Technical report explaining results, limitations, and deployment considerations

Skills: Python, ML modeling, ML pipelines, model evaluation, documentation.
